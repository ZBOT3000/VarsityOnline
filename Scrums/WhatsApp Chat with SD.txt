3/7/19, 12:58 - Joy: Aren't we supposed to make a new branch on github... Or should we just keep committing to the master branch?

3/7/19, 17:33 - Lungile: im also confused
3/7/19, 17:36 - Fentse: The way you're able to see if your commit builds is by either going to pull request(like how i showed you on the vid) or going to the actual site
3/7/19, 17:41 - Joy: <Media omitted>
3/7/19, 17:47 - Fentse: Travis builds your project and runs tests to check for errors
3/7/19, 17:47 - Joy: How though?
3/7/19, 17:50 - Fentse: When you run your build,Travis clones your github repo into a new environment,and carries out a series of tasks to build and test code
3/7/19, 17:52 - Joy: Is it an automatic thing... Or did you set the task for it to build
3/7/19, 18:00 - Lungile: what needs to go in the wiki

Because lamp won't allow you to create a new database

5/2/19, 13:32 - Lungile: Nah just tablea
