10/7/19, 17:36 - Fentse: The way you're able to see if your commit builds is by either going to pull request(like how i showed you on the vid) or going to the actual site
10/7/19, 17:41 - Joy: <Media omitted>
10/7/19, 17:47 - Fentse: Travis builds your project and runs tests to check for errors
10/7/19, 17:47 - Joy: How though?
10/7/19, 17:50 - Fentse: When you run your build,Travis clones your github repo into a new environment,and carries out a series of tasks to build and test code
10/7/19, 17:52 - Joy: Is it an automatic thing... Or did you set the task for it to build

Because lamp won't allow you to create a new database

5/2/19, 13:32 - Lungile: Nah just tablea
